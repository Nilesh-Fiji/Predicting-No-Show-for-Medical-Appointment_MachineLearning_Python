# Predicting No-Show Medical Appointment_MachineLearning_Python
This project is inspired by the business context that a person makes a doctor appointment, receives the instructions and then either shows up or does not show up on the appointment date. A ‘no-show’ is a hindrance for doctors, patients, and hospital business in general. Patients who need an appointment earlier have to wait longer and the doctor loses time in which s/he could have seen more patients (unless the doctor can find someone to come in place of the no show). It disturbs the system and becomes problematic to the business, as it is happening 30% of time currently. With the aid of predictive analytics, I want to see if it is possible to predict an appointment to be a “no-show”.
